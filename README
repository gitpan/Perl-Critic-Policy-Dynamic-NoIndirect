NAME
    Perl::Critic::Policy::Dynamic::NoIndirect - Perl::Critic policy against
    indirect method calls.

VERSION
    Version 0.02

DESCRIPTION
    This Perl::Critic dynamic policy reports any use of indirect object
    syntax with a 'stern' severity. It's listed under the 'dynamic' and
    'maintenance' themes.

    Since it wraps around indirect, it needs to compile the audited code and
    as such is implemented as a subclass of Perl::Critic::DynamicPolicy.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.8, Carp.

    Perl::Critic, Perl::Critic::Dynamic.

    indirect.
